        <p id="large"><b>HackNotts</b> is a 24 hour hackathon brought to you by the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/">University of Nottingham</a> along with <a href="https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/">HackSoc</a>. Tickets are free so they go quick! Get them <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trollface">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>24 hours to design, coordinate and execute an idea:</h2>
        <p>Each year we have students travel from across the far ends of the country collaborating, prototyping, and accomplishing amazing and innovative ideas in only a 24 hour time frame.</p>
        <p>You'll learn new skills from both the many attendees along with the informative workshops hosted by the sponsors and organisers of this event.</p>
        <p>You don't have to be a software or hardware wizard to attend, no matter your skill level you will be able to brainstorm and produce something and hopefully learn something along the way.</p>
        <p>Have a look at the <a href="./about/">About</a> page to find out much more information about what the Hackathon involves.</p>

        <h2>Win prizes based on different categories:</h2>
        <p>We have various prizes you'll be sure to want to win in several categories including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Overall winners for 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> place</li>
            <li>First timer hacker</li>
            <li>Hackiest hack</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other categories might be added so keep an eye open for any updates!</p>

        <h2>Important team information:</h2>
        <p>Please note that we have limited prizes for each category, so we must limit the team sizes to a <b>maximum of 4</b>. If you don't have a team then don't panic, you can still participate on your own. If you want to find a team however, then closer to the time we will be opening our Discord server with a <b>#find-a-team</b> channel where you can discuss preliminary ideas along with finding possible team-mates.</p>

        <h2>Discord server:</h2>
        <p>As said above, closer to the time we will open the <b>HackNotts '23</b> Discord server. So, check your emails for the invite link when it gets sent out if you have a ticket! You can discuss travel arrangements, any questions you may have and anything else HackNotts related there :). This is also our main method to communicate, and important announcements will be made there along with directions to campus and much more. So please join to stay up to date. See you on the 11<sup>th</sup> of February 2023!</p>
