        <h2>Who can attend?</h2>
        <p>Anyone who is currently a student or has graduated from any university in the past year is welcome to attend, regardless of skill level or degree course.</p>

        <h2>How do I get a ticket?</h2>
        <p>Tickets can be bought <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>What can I do at HackNotts?</h2>
        <p>The main event is a competition between hackers. However, there are loads of other activities to get involved with such as workshops hosted by sponsors and organisers alongside games. More can be found on the <a href="../about">About</a> page.</p>

        <h2>Do I get free stuff?</h2>
        <p><b><i>YES</i></b> you absolutely do get loads of free stuff. You'll get food, swag and many stickers! Along with any prizes you may win!</p>

        <h2>How does the judging work?</h2>
        <p>When you've finished your project submit it to <a href="https://devpost.com/" target="_blank">Devpost</a> and enter into as many categories that suit your project. A winner is selected for each prize, either by ourselves or for our sponsored prizes, our sponsors. Each team will demonstrate their project after hacking ends to the judges. If you've never even heard of Devpost before, we will cover this during the hackathon and how to submit your project using the site.</p>

        <h2>What if I don't know how to code?</h2>
        <p>No worries, hackathons are a great place to get into coding. Almost everybody there will be happy to help you get started, especially if you join a team. We even have a beginners prize, so you won't just be up against people who've been coding for half their lives. Also, you could contribute to your team by doing non-coding things like graphics or music.</p>

        <h2>How long do I have?</h2>
        <p>You have 24 hours to make your project! You can only work on your project during this time frame. You can find out more <a href="../about#project">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>How can I help out?</h2>
        <p>You can volunteer at this hackathon and we are always welcome to volunteers helping us out! See the <a href="../about#volunteering">About</a> page for more information on volunteering!</p>

        <h2>How do I get there?</h2>
        <p>We recommend using public transport wherever possible as there is limited parking on campus so we cannot guarantee a spot. There will be more information on travel in the Discord server.</p>

        <h2>I still have questions!</h2>
        <p>Have a read through the <a href="../">Home</a> and <a href="../about">About</a> page just in case it has been mentioned there, if not then feel free to <a href="mailto:committee@hacksocnotts.co.uk">email</a> us or get in touch on Discord when the server is live! Invitations will be emailed to you with the address you used when getting your ticket.</p>
