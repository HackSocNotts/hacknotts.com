## Best Breakfast Challenge

- All work on a ~~project~~ breakfast should be done at the hackathon. ~~Projects~~ Breakfasts started before the hackathon are not allowed. If you are unsure if you can work on something, speak to the organisers as early as possible.
- Entrants can use an idea they had before the event.
- Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. ~~Hacks~~ Breakfasts do not have to be “innovative”. If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their ~~hack~~ breakfast. These days it’s hard to find something that’s fully original and entrants might not know an idea has been done before anyway.
- Adding new features to existing ~~projects~~ breakfasts is allowed. Judges will only consider new ~~functionality~~ flavour and texture introduced or new elements added during the hackathon in determining the winners. However, you must make this clear in your submission, if you don't you may be prematurly disqualifed.
- Submission shall be via tweeting a picture, collection of pictures or short video using the hashtag `#hacknottsbreakfast` before 8:30 am Sunday 29th November 2020.
