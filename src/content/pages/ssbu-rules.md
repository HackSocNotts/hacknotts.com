- If your opponent is offline/afk, they have 10 minutes to respond/show up, otherwise they automatically lose
- One person hosts a public arena with a password and sends the ID and password to the opponent (this is faster), or add each other as friends and host a friends-only arena
- A USB ethernet adapter over wireless is recommended to improve your connection, but of course this isn't mandatory as long as you still have a decent connection :)

## Set Procedure
- All sets' first game will be **Pokémon Stadium 2**
- Previous game's winner bans 2 stages from the stage list, the losing player picks from the remaining
- Players are not allowed to pick the most recent stage that they won on
- Bans are reset every game (i.e. a banned stage in the second game does not mean it is banned for the third)
