### So where is HackNotts? 

- The two focal points of the event will be the HackNotts 2020 Discord and the HackathonsUK Twitch. 

### What can I do at HackNotts?

- Everyone who grabs a ticket with swag, has a mailing address in the UK and submits valid a project will be getting a swag bag after the event with all the goodies you’d expect from a Hackathon and of course stickers. 

### Free food? 

- No... Okay, look... We are trying to bring all the elements of HackNotts to you in 2020, but sorry, no. 

### Okay, but what do I need to do? 

- Have fun, make something new, submit it. 

### Is that it? 

- Well, we hope you learn something and meet someone new, but basically yes. You can read the full rules here to make sure you project is valid. 

### But I don’t have a team? 

- Don't panic, we will be starting our event with a team building workshop to bring you together with other Hackers looking to form teams. 

### But I don’t know how to code? 

- Not a problem, Hackathons are a classic place to get into coding with Hackers being some of the most supportive and each to help people in the world it’s easy to find a mentor to get you started with code, and we even have a beginners prize for first time coders. 

### But I can’t connect to the internet? 

- How are you reading this? Did someone print this for you? Are you going to recycle this when you’re done? You better. Though we will be taking place and submitting online a poor internet connection isn’t a huge barrier to entry, all the news to keep up with the event will be posted to Discord and if you are happy with your ability to talk to your team not having a stable connection to stream video doesn’t mean you can’t get involved. 

### How do I prepare? 

- Grab a ticket and make sure your weekend is free, getting a team together and thinking about your idea are optional, all you need to do it log on on Saturday morning and tune in.  

### Can I start working on my idea now? 

- No, to be a valid project you have to have only started working on your project one hacking commences on Saturday morning. 

### Can I get involved before the event? 

- Soon as you’ve got a ticket you can come join us on the HackNotts 2020 Discord and begin to get involved. 

### Do I have to code for 24 hours straight? 

- You can, but you don’t have to, balancing sleep alongside everything else going on over the weekend can be tough but it is thoroughly recommended to get good sleep.
