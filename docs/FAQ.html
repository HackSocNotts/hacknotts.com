      <div class="FAQTitle">How does the judging work?</div>
      <div class="FAQexplanation">When you've finished your project submit it to <span class="highlight">Devpost</span>
        and enter into as many categories
        that suit your project. A winner is selected for each prize category, either by ourselves or for our sponsored
        prizes,
        our sponsors. Each team will demonstrate their project after hacking ends to the judges. If you've never even
        heard of
        Devpost before, we will cover this during the hackathon and how to submit your project using the site.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="row mb-5">
      <div class="FAQTitle">How large can my team be?</div>

        have a team then don't panic, you can still
        participate on your own. If you want to find a team however, then closer to the time we will be opening our
        Discord server with
        a <span class="highlight">#find-a-team</span> channel where you can discuss preliminary ideas along with finding

        there will be more
        information on the discord server.
