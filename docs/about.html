    <div class="subTitle"> WHAT IS HACKNOTTS?</div>
    <div class="row h-10"></div>
    <p><br>HackNotts is an annual hackathon held by HackSoc at the University of Nottingham. It's a two-day
      overnight hackathon for all skill levels taking place on October 26th and 27th 2024.
    </p>
    <p>This is a great opportunity to connect with like-minded people and discuss new ideas and projects.
      Teams are not mandatory and there will be loads of opportunity to find one, including a team building activity on
      the day
      and a <span class="highlight">#find-a-team</span> Discord channel. Aside from developing, workshops and stunning
      (free!) food, there will also be games
      and other events to keep you entertained. Check out the <a class="highlightLink" href="'#">Activities</a> page for
      a list of
      acitivites! There's something for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will be numerous workshops during the event with a variety of topics, from hardware to software and life
      skills.
      Our sponsors will also be holding workshops! Check them out on the <a class="highlightLink" href="#">Sponsors</a>
      page.
      All meals and drinks will be provided for free including lunch on both days, dinner on the 26th and breakfast on
      the 27th.
      Feel free to bring anything else as well to keep going, just be thoughtful of any possible allergens that people
      could have (e.g. nuts)
    </p>

  <div class="row mb-5">
    <div class="subTitle">WHERE TO FIND US?</div>
    <div class="row h-10"></div>
    <p><br>HackNotts is held at the University of Nottingham and will take place in the Computer Science
      building on Jubilee Campus.
      More information about direction and travel can be found on the discord server.

  <div class="row mb-5">
    <div class="subTitle">WHAT CAN I MAKE?</div>
    <div class="row h-10"></div>

    <p><br>There aren't any rules as to what you can and cannot make - within reason. The only requirement is
      that it must be done in a 24 hour period. Old code or libraries can be reused but the bulk of the project must be
      done during
      the Hackathon.
    </p>
    <p>If you choose something hardware related, please remember that we cannot allow soldering due to
      lack of ventilation, however you can always use breadboards. We might be able to provide generic components, so
      let us know
      if you plan to do something hardware based when ordering your ticket (or afterwards on the discord server) and we
      will try to
      accomodate.
    </p>
    <p>Also, it's important to remember that even if you are a beginner, that's okay! Hackathons are a great
      learning experience and we have some categories specifically for beginners. You can learn about new APIs, coding
      practices along
      with a multitude of other skills for your CV or future career.
    </p>
    <p>There have been some very cool projects made in the past and we're certain this year won't be any different!
      For some inspiration, feel free to check out <a class="highlightLink" href="https://hn84.devpost.com">Last year's
        devpost</a>!
      We hope to see you there :)
    </p>

  <div class="row mb-5">
    <div class="subTitle">WANT TO BE INVOLVED AND NOT CODE?</div>
    <div class="row h-10"></div>
    <p><br>HackNotts also offers many other opportunities if you are not a coder but still want to be involved.
      One way is to contribute to a team in a non-coding way! Some examples could be doing art for a project, managing
      it or
      pitching in ideas. All contribution counts!
    </p>
    <p>HackNotts also looks for <a class="highlightLink" href="https://forms.office.com/e/BA864UTwqF">volunteers</a>.
      With such a big event,
      the volunteers are the core of running the event. It involves running the Hackathon alongside the organisers,
      chaperoning people around the
      building and generally lending a hand. You'll still get all the free food and drinks alongside the hackers!
    </p>
    <p>Please also be aware that as a volunteer you won't be able to submit a project for judging. If you have
      any questions about volunteering, please <a class="highlightLink" href="mailto:hacknotts@hacksocnotts.co.uk">email
        us</a>.
      Volunteering is a great opportunity to build many skills such as leadership, mentoring and communication.
    </p>
    <p>You can find the volunteer application form <a class="highlightLink"
        href="https://forms.office.com/e/BA864UTwqF">here</a>.
